//Directions:

// Fix the errors in the code editor so that it is valid JSX and successfully transpiles. Make sure you don't change any of the content - you only need to close tags where they are needed.

//Given Code

const JSX = (
  <div>
    {/* remove comment and change code below this line
    <h2>Welcome to React!</h2> <br >
    <p>Be sure to close all tags!</p>
    <hr >
    remove comment and change code above this line */}
  </div>
);

//Solution:

const JSX = (
  <div>
    
    <h2>Welcome to React!</h2> <br />
    <p>Be sure to close all tags!</p>
    <hr />
        
  </div>
);
