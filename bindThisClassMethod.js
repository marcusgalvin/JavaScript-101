//Directions:

// The code editor has a component with a state that keeps track of an item count. It also has a method which allows you to increment this item count. However, the method doesn't work because it's using the this keyword that is undefined. Fix it by explicitly binding this to the addItem() method in the component's constructor.

// Next, add a click handler to the button element in the render method. It should trigger the addItem() method when the button receives a click event. Remember that the method you pass to the onClick handler needs curly braces because it should be interpreted directly as JavaScript.

// Once you complete the above steps you should be able to click the button and see the item count increment in the HTML.

//given code:

class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      itemCount: 0
    };
    // change code below this line

    // change code above this line
  }
  addItem() {
    this.setState({
      itemCount: this.state.itemCount + 1
    });
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        { /* change code below this line */ }
        <button>Click Me</button>
        { /* change code above this line */ }
        <h1>Current Item Count: {this.state.itemCount}</h1>
      </div>
    );
  }
};

//Solution:

class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      itemCount: 0
    };
    // change code below this line
    this.addItem = this.addItem.bind(this);
    // change code above this line
  }
  addItem() {
    this.setState({
      itemCount: this.state.itemCount + 1
    });
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        { /* change code below this line */ }
        <button onClick={this.addItem}>Click Me</button>
        { /* change code above this line */ }
        <h1>Current Item Count: {this.state.itemCount}</h1>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
